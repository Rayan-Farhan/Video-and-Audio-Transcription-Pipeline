    "text": " Hello all, my name is Krishnayak and welcome to my YouTube channel. So guys, I am super excited to announce our new Udemy course that is nothing but building AI agents and agent-tki systems with the help of Microsoft Autogen. Now if you don't know, Microsoft Autogen is also one of the most popular framework that will be specifically used to develop agent-tki applications. Now in the world of error, wherein everybody is focusing on building AI agents and agent-tki system, it is important that we have knowledge with respect to multiple frameworks and that is the reason me and my entire team are working really, really hard to come up with some amazing courses in an affordable way wherein we cover all the specific frameworks in much more in depth. I've already uploaded one course with respect to Langraph. Now we are going to cover up with Microsoft Autogen and the feedback from all the specific courses has been quite amazing and people are really demanding for more and more different kind of use cases and different kind of implementation where we can develop agent-tki system such that we take it into the production level. So anybody who is specifically interested into getting into Genitive AI, agent-tki, then this is the course definitely for you. In this video, I'll be talking more about this particular course is what all things you can, you will be learning, what are the prerequisites that you actually require in order to learn this and many more things. So first of all, here in this particular course, this has been collaborated with Mayank Agarwal. I hope everybody knows about Mayank Agarwal. He is the part of my team where we are focusing on understanding what all things people definitely require to get into this specific industry. So here to go ahead with right now this particular course, fees is only 399 rupees and understand if you just need to use a coupon which is called as agent-tik 01. As I said, the course price is very, very minimal, less than a Starbucks coffee and this entire course will be available for lifetime. You also have 30 days refund policy. So let's say you buy this particular course, try out the videos and if you don't like it within 30 days, you can also get the refund. What is the main aim in this particular course is to build powerful AI agents, automate tasks and create advanced agent-tik AI system. Since Microsoft Autogen is from Microsoft itself, so definitely you can understand what will be the importance of this particular framework. Because right now there are some less number of companies which are rarely, rarely competitive in this market with respect to developing LLM models, frameworks and many more things. Microsoft have definitely come up with this something called as Autogen for a specific purpose. So in this course you'll learn all about what are agents, how to create autonomous agents, how to interact with the Microsoft Autogen framework, set up or configure Autogen to build AI systems, design and implement custom agents and chatbots. We'll be talking about tasks like coding, reasoning and decision making, build and deploy rail world, multi-agents workflow that automates complex end-to-end tasks. So here we are only not focusing on building, we are also focusing on doing the deployment. So overall this course will be having somewhere around 32.5 hours of course and as we go ahead there are some more projects that needs to be included. So first of all we go ahead with Python. Python is the prerequisites that you definitely require. Then you have Python-tik, then we start with entire Autogen and if you keep on expanding, they are projects, they are use cases, they are good things, they are techniques like how to probably add human in the loop, feedback, how to probably go ahead and create a single agent, how to go ahead and create a multi-agent, how to make agent communicate with the other agent, how to make sure to do this collaboration of multi-agent in Autogen, all this specific thing is done. Not only that, we also talk about performance metrics, we talk about building and configuring the Autogen agent itself. We have also shown you how to go ahead and use the Autogen Studio. So they are a whole set of topics that has been discussed with respect to this and super, super excited to launch this particular course. Now there is one more announcement that whoever is from my Krishnak.in batch in the live classes, I hope you have taken this agent-tik AI. So if you are from this specific batch or agent-tik 1.0 batch, don't worry, you don't need to probably take this particular course because this course will be provided completely for free for everyone out there. And this is the pattern that we follow. Whoever is the part of our live batches, we usually provide them free courses from the Udemy so that they get the live access. Along with this, I would suggest go ahead and try it out, each and everything over here. The prerequisite for this is that you need to have some amount of Python programming language knowledge, even though if you don't have, I have already provided it. You should know how to write modular coding. You should have some understanding of LLM models, generative AI models and all. Less than all the things, you know, we have explained things in a much more better way. Each and every topics that you will be specifically seeing over here will be crisps and detail, the kind of materials, resources that we have specifically used. And everything is available for lifetime at just a price of 399. This offer just stays for two days. So go ahead and utilize this opportunity. And yes, this was it from my side. I hope you like this particular video. I'll see you all in the next video. Thank you. Have a great day. Bye bye. Take care.",

    "text": "Hello all, my name is Krishnayak and welcome to my YouTube channel. So guys, I am super excited to announce our new Udemy course that is nothing but building AI agents and agent-tki systems with the help of Microsoft Autogen. Now if you don't know, Microsoft Autogen is also one of the most popular framework that will be specifically used to develop agent-tki applications. Now in the world of error, wherein everybody is focusing on building AI agents and agent-tki system, it is important that we have knowledge with respect to multiple frameworks and that is the reason me and my entire team are working really, really hard to come up with some amazing courses in an affordable way wherein we cover all the specific frameworks in much more in depth. I've already uploaded one course with respect to Langraph. Now we are going to cover up with Microsoft Autogen and the feedback from all the specific courses has been quite amazing and people are really demanding for more and more different kind of use cases and different kind of implementation where we can develop agent-tki system such that we take it into the production level. So anybody who is specifically interested into getting into Genitive AI, agent-tki, then this is the course definitely for you. In this video, I'll be talking more about this particular course is what all things you can, you will be learning, what are the prerequisites that you actually require in order to learn this and many more things. So first of all, here in this particular course, this has been collaborated with Mayank Agarwal. I hope everybody knows about Mayank Agarwal. He is the part of my team where we are focusing on understanding what all things people definitely require to get into this specific industry. So here to go ahead with right now this particular course, fees is only 399 rupees and understand if you just need to use a coupon which is called as agent-tik 01. As I said, the course price is very, very minimal, less than a Starbucks coffee and this entire course will be available for lifetime. You also have 30 days refund policy. So let's say you buy this particular course, try out the videos and if you don't like it within 30 days, you can also get the refund. What is the main aim in this particular course is to build powerful AI agents, automate tasks and create advanced agent-tik AI system. Since Microsoft Autogen is from Microsoft itself, so definitely you can understand what will be the importance of this particular framework. Because right now there are some less number of companies which are rarely, rarely competitive in this market with respect to developing LLM models, frameworks and many more things. Microsoft have definitely come up with this something called as Autogen for a specific purpose. So in this course you'll learn all about what are agents, how to create autonomous agents, how to interact with the Microsoft Autogen framework, set up or configure Autogen to build AI systems, design and implement custom agents and chatbots. We'll be talking about tasks like coding, reasoning and decision making, build and deploy rail world, multi-agents workflow that automates complex end-to-end tasks. So here we are only not focusing on building, we are also focusing on doing the deployment. So overall this course will be having somewhere around 32.5 hours of course and as we go ahead there are some more projects that needs to be included. So first of all we go ahead with Python. Python is the prerequisites that you definitely require. Then you have Python-tik, then we start with entire Autogen and if you keep on expanding, they are projects, they are use cases, they are good things, they are techniques like how to probably add human in the loop, feedback, how to probably go ahead and create a single agent, how to go ahead and create a multi-agent, how to make agent communicate with the other agent, how to make sure to do this collaboration of multi-agent in Autogen, all this specific thing is done. Not only that, we also talk about performance metrics, we talk about building and configuring the Autogen agent itself. We have also shown you how to go ahead and use the Autogen Studio. So they are a whole set of topics that has been discussed with respect to this and super, super excited to launch this particular course. Now there is one more announcement that whoever is from my Krishnak.in batch in the live classes, I hope you have taken this agent-tik AI. So if you are from this specific batch or agent-tik 1.0 batch, don't worry, you don't need to probably take this particular course because this course will be provided completely for free for everyone out there. And this is the pattern that we follow. Whoever is the part of our live batches, we usually provide them free courses from the Udemy so that they get the live access. Along with this, I would suggest go ahead and try it out, each and everything over here. The prerequisite for this is that you need to have some amount of Python programming language knowledge, even though if you don't have, I have already provided it. You should know how to write modular coding. You should have some understanding of LLM models, generative AI models and all.

Now if you don't know, Microsoft Autogen is also one of the most popular framework that  will be specifically used to develop agent-tki applications.  Now in the world of error, wherein everybody is focusing on building AI agents and agent-tki  system, it is important that we have knowledge with respect to multiple frameworks and that  is the reason me and my entire team are working really, really hard to come up with some amazing  courses in an affordable way wherein we cover all the specific frameworks in much more in  depth.  I've already uploaded one course with respect to Langraph.  Now we are going to cover up with Microsoft Autogen and the feedback from all the specific  courses has been quite amazing and people are really demanding for more and more different",

So first of all, here in this particular course, this has been collaborated with Mayank Agarwal.  I hope everybody knows about Mayank Agarwal.  He is the part of my team where we are focusing on understanding what all things people definitely  require to get into this specific industry.  So here to go ahead with right now this particular course, fees is only 399 rupees and understand  if you just need to use a coupon which is called as agent-tik 01.

What is the main aim in this particular course is to build powerful AI agents, automate tasks  and create advanced agent-tik AI system.  Since Microsoft Autogen is from Microsoft itself, so definitely you can understand what  will be the importance of this particular framework.  Because right now there are some less number of companies which are rarely, rarely competitive  in this market with respect to developing LLM models, frameworks and many more things.  Microsoft have definitely come up with this something called as Autogen for a specific  purpose.  So in this course you'll learn all about what are agents, how to create autonomous agents,  how to interact with the Microsoft Autogen framework, set up or configure Autogen to  build AI systems, design and implement custom agents and chatbots.  We'll be talking about tasks like coding, reasoning and decision making, build and deploy",

Python is the prerequisites that you definitely require.  Then you have Python-tik, then we start with entire Autogen and if you keep on expanding,  they are projects, they are use cases, they are good things, they are techniques like  how to probably add human in the loop, feedback, how to probably go ahead and create a single  agent, how to go ahead and create a multi-agent, how to make agent communicate with the other  agent, how to make sure to do this collaboration of multi-agent in Autogen, all this specific  thing is done.  Not only that, we also talk about performance metrics, we talk about building and configuring  the Autogen agent itself.  We have also shown you how to go ahead and use the Autogen Studio.",

So if you are from this specific batch or agent-tik 1.0 batch, don't worry, you don't  need to probably take this particular course because this course will be provided completely  for free for everyone out there.  And this is the pattern that we follow.  Whoever is the part of our live batches, we usually provide them free courses from the  Udemy so that they get the live access.  Along with this, I would suggest go ahead and try it out, each and everything over here.  The prerequisite for this is that you need to have some amount of Python programming  language knowledge, even though if you don't have, I have already provided it.  You should know how to write modular coding.  You should have some understanding of LLM models, generative AI models and all.
